          <span>11 May 2023 / Huawei Management Training</span>
          <a href="#" class="blog-title">Preparing for opportunities</a>
          <p>Hi everyone!
          
          I'm so excited to share with you my experience of attending a Huawei management training program as a computer science
          student. It was an amazing opportunity to learn from the experts and to network with other talented students.
          
          The session covered topics such as leadership, communication, innovation, and teamwork. They were very friendly and
          inspiring, and they gave us valuable advice on how to succeed in the tech industry. I was impressed by Huawei's vision
          and culture, and I felt proud to be part of their global community.
          
          I want to thank Huawei for this incredible experience and for investing in the future leaders of the digital world. I
          also want to thank my fellow students for their support and friendship. I had a blast and I hope to keep in touch with
          everyone.
          
          If you are interested in applying for the next Huawei management training program, you can find more information on
          their website. Trust me, you won't regret it!</p>

          <span>17 May 2023 / Microsoft Azure and GitHub</span>
          <a href="#" class="blog-title">Azure and GitHub 101: My Experience</a>
          <p>Hi everyone!
          
          I'm so excited to share with you my experience of attending an introductory session on Microsoft Azure and GitHub. It
          was a great opportunity to learn more about these amazing tools and how they can help me as a computer science student.
          <span class="read-more-text" id="read-more-text">
            The session was organized by the Microsoft Student Ambassadors and it covered the basics of cloud computing, Azure
            services, GitHub repositories, and GitHub Actions. I learned how to create an Azure account, set up a GitHub repository,
            and deploy a web app using GitHub Actions. It was very easy and fun!
            
            I also got to interact with other students and mentors who were passionate about technology and innovation. They gave me
            some useful tips and resources to continue my learning journey. I'm looking forward to exploring more features of Azure
            and GitHub and applying them to my projects.
            
            If you are interested in learning more about Azure and GitHub, I highly recommend you to check out the Microsoft Learn
            platform and the GitHub Learning Lab. They have some awesome courses and tutorials that will help you get started.
            
            Thank you for reading my blog post. I hope you enjoyed it and learned something new. Stay tuned for more updates on my
            adventures in computer science!
